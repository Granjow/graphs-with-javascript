This is a tutorial on graph algorithms. It is using [adventure](https://www.npmjs.com/package/adventure).

Install this adventure with

    npm install -g graphs-with-javascript

and then use

    g-w-j

to start your adventure!

**Note for Windows users:** You have to [download Node.js v0.12.6](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.12.6/node-v0.12.6-x86.msi)
for Windows since adventure will not work with 4.x yet. [See this bug.](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/issues/1448)

## What you will learn

Goal is to write a number of different exercises which will give you a good understanding of graphs and using them
to solve various types of problems. More exercises will be added. Current progress:

                                   problem           verifier
                                 | written         | written            | done
    Introduction ————————————————-—————————————————-————————————————————X
    Get started with this adventure and verify your first exercise.
    
    Vertices + Edges ————————————-—————————————————-————————————————————X
    Create a data structure for edges and vertices; preparation for
    later exercises.
    
    Graphs ——————————————————————-—————————————————-————————————————————X
    Create a Graph data structure which manages the vertices and edges
    from the previous exercise.
    
    Reading Problems —————————
    Read large graphs from files.
    
    Under Siege —————————————————x
    Help the city ABC, which is under siege, to defend itself with your
    new knowledge!
