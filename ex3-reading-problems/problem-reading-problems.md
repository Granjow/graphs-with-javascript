# Reading Problems

## Goal

Read graphs from input files.

## Problem Description

So far, we were quite lucky with our graphs consisting of a few nodes only. That changes now! Graphs may 
consist of thousands of nodes, and nobody wants to manually type `new Vertex( id )` for every single one
of them.
