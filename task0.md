# Getting Started

This task is here to get your environment running.

The following example file exports a function `randomValue`.

    function demo() { 
        return 42; 
    }
    
    module.exports = { randomValue: demo };

Your task is to write a JavaScript file for node.js which exports a function `hello`. The function should simply return the string 
`'hello'`.
